							My journey in the world of IT and technology began in 2010 when I started working as a consultant specializing in Outsystems. Over the four years in this role, I gained valuable experience in developing and implementing solutions for various clients, contributing to their digital transformation. This experience was foundational in shaping my problem-solving skills and my ability to adapt to different technological environments.
						</p>
						<p>
							From 2014 to 2021, I worked as a Front-End Developer. During this seven-year period, I honed my skills in web development, creating user-friendly and visually appealing websites. My experience in front-end development provided me with a strong understanding of user experience and interface design, which I now apply to ensure that the software I test not only functions well but also delivers a seamless user experience.
						</p>
						<p>
							Since 2021, I have been dedicated to my role as a Quality Engineer Analyst, where I focus on ensuring the highest standards of quality and performance in every project I undertake. In this role, I have developed and implemented rigorous testing protocols and collaborated closely with development teams to enhance product reliability and user satisfaction.
						</p>
						<p>
							Currently, in 2024, I am working at Intermedia as a Software Developer Engineer in Test. I started this position in January of 2024. My responsibilities include both manual and automated testing, utilizing Playwright with TypeScript to ensure our software meets the highest standards of performance and reliability. This role allows me to leverage my expertise in both quality assurance and software development, bridging the gap between the two to deliver superior products.
						</p>
						<p>
							I am a proud alum of the Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto (ISEP), where I acquired the knowledge and foundation that have allowed me to excel in my career. The education I received at ISEP was instrumental in building my technical expertise and my approach to engineering challenges.
